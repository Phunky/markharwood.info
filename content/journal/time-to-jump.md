I handed in my notice at the beginning of July, a time when most people are worrying about redundancy due to COVID-19 and the uncertainty that it has brought to the world. However for me it confirmed what I had been feeling for sometime, it was time to jump, to move on, to find something that would align better with myself and my values on how to build products.

I’m grateful for the opportunity I was given while building the product and team behind [Mobilleo](https://mobilleo.com) as those first years of building out the infrastructure, API and CI/CD pipelines where some of the most enjoyable work I’ve ever done. We moved fast, we hit huge roadblocks but we found our way around and built out a strong flexible foundation for what would come in the future.

I was never really happy with how strategic decisions were being made, no time was being spent understanding or validating scenarios. It was just feature bloat and chasing all the shiny things other products did. This led to a lot of development churn and little innovation, which slowly killed me inside and I eventually snapped, I couldn’t carry on...  

I could not continue to lead the development of a product I no longer believed in myself. After eight years I’m leaving [Fleetondemand](https://fleetondemand.com) and looking forward to joining an old contracting friend at [Orca Scan](https://orcascan.com/).
