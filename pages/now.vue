    <p>So we're on week <strong>15</strong> of lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic and <span class="line-through">I'm currently furloughed from my day job</span> I've handed in my notice at <a href="https://www.fleetondemand.com" target="_blank">Fleetondemand</a> after <strong>eight years</strong> and looking forward to a fresh start next month.</p>
    <p>Lockdown is still a bit of a struggle but I think we've all got used to the new way of life now and if I'm honest I really needed the rest as it forced me to reassess my priorities and realign them with what I actually want to achieve.</p>
    <h2>Manifesting</h2>

      <li>Kick start Made by Phunky and start Freelancing/Consulting again.</li>
