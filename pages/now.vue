    <p>I'm currently preparing for a lot of upcoming changes with the new job starting in August, it's remote based which should enable to produce my best work at a time that fits me. While also allow me to do more of what I enjoy without having to think about commuting, dress codes or office politics.</p>
    <p><strong>I can't wait!</strong></p>
    <p>At the start of July I decided that I would build some new habits, one of which was to run daily, something I've said I would do many times in the past but never followed through on. However this time I've done just that and really am starting to enjoy waking up a 6am and falling out of bed for a run.</p>

    <p>I've started writing on here too which is great to see and the plan is to put something out once a week. I would like to do some technical writing but will have to see if inspiration hits me or not.</p>
    <h2>Manifesting</h2>
